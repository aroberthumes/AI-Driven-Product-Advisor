# AI-Driven-Product-Advisor

The AI-Driven Product Advisor is a sophisticated recommendation system built for e-commerce platforms, leveraging artificial intelligence to provide content-based product suggestions. It enhances the shopping experience by personalizing product recommendations based on the analysis of product descriptions.

# Features

- AI-Powered Recommendations: Utilizes AI techniques for intelligent product suggestions.
- Content-Based Filtering: Analyzes product descriptions to find similar items.
- Advanced Text Processing: Implements lemmatization and custom stop words removal for text data.
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Efficiently converts text into meaningful numerical vectors.
- Cosine Similarity Analysis: Employs cosine similarity for assessing product similarity.

# Installation
Clone the repository:

<pre lang="no-highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI-Driven-Product-Advisor.git</code></pre>


# Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python packages installed:

pandas
scikit-learn
nltk
You can install these packages using pip:

Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk
How to Use
Load your e-commerce dataset into a pandas DataFrame:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

file_path = 'path_to_your_dataset.csv'  # Update with your dataset path
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
Execute the script to preprocess the data and initialize the recommendation engine.

To get recommendations:

python
Copy code
product_name = "Enter a Product Name Here"  # Use an actual product name from your dataset
recommendations = get_recommendations(product_name)
print(recommendations)
Code Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and unnecessary columns.
Text Preprocessing: Applies NLTK lemmatization to the product descriptions.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Transforms text data into a TF-IDF matrix.
Cosine Similarity: Calculates similarity scores between products.
Recommendation Function: get_recommendations function to provide product recommendations.
